# Unity MinecraftArkanoid

Project developed during the 6th Trimester for the Games (https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/VJ) subject. It was implemented using Unity and coded in C#, applying concepts and elements learned throughout the course. The game is only in Spanish yet.

## Project Overview

This project is a modern 3D reinterpretation of the classic arcade game 

Arkanoid, developed using Unity. The main goal is to destroy all blocks on a level by bouncing a ball with a player-controlled paddle, combining elements of skill, reflexes, and strategy while retaining the original's arcade essence. 


Key features of this adaptation include:
* Retro Minimalist Visual Style: Inspired by the aesthetics of Minecraft. 
* Fluid Paddle Movement and Realistic Ball Physics. 
* Diverse Block Types: Including normal, resistant, and indestructible blocks, each yielding different points. 
* Variety of Power-ups: Randomly generated upon breaking blocks, such as increasing/decreasing paddle size, "Powerball" (breaks all destructible blocks in one hit), "Magnet" (ball sticks to paddle), extra lives, paddle speed boost, experience multipliers, level skip, and protective walls (glass/quartz). 
* User-Friendly HUD: Displays score, remaining lives, current level, and an approximation of destroyed blocks. 
* Intuitive Game Flow: Navigates through a main menu, active game screen, game over, victory, and credits screens. 

The development followed a collaborative methodology using Gitflow for version control on GitHub, and scenes were divided into independent Unity scenes to minimize conflicts. This project provided valuable experience in game development fundamentals, object-oriented programming, and project management, demonstrating a functional result faithful to the original's spirit, ready for future expansions.
